\begin{rSection}{Profile}
I am a PhD student in applied and computational mathematics working on modelling and optimization of industrial processes. A particular focus of my work lies on model simulation and the implementation of efficient and robust optimization algorithms in Matlab. My career goal is to bring my mathematical expertise from academia into industry, to help tackle the various challenges that we are faced with as a society today, while continuously growing my own skill set in the process. A crucial aspect of working with industry is the ability to explain mathematical results to a non-scientific audience, which is why I made science communication a priority in my PhD training. I have also co-organised several events which aim at building connections within the student community, to other scientific disciplines and to industry. I believe that innovative solutions to real-world problems are found through interdisciplinary collaboration and that effectively applied mathematics can have a significant impact on this process.
