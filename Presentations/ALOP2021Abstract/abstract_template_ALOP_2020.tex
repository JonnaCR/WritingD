There are many industrial and biological processes, such as beer brewing, nano-separation of colloids and bird flocking, which can be described by integro-PDEs. These PDEs describe the dynamics of a ‘particle’ density within a fluid bath, under the influence of diffusion, external forces, and particle interactions. They often include nonlinear, nonlocal boundary conditions. 
A key challenge is to optimize these types of processes, which requires tools from PDE-constrained optimization. In this talk I will introduce a numerical method to solve this class of optimal control problems, which combines pseudospectral methods and spectral elements with a sweeping algorithm. This provides a tool for the fast and accurate solution of the resulting optimality systems. Finally, some examples of current work and future industrial applications will be given.
