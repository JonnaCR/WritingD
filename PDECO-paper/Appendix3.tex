\section{Comparing the fixed point algorithm with \texttt{fsolve}}
\label{app:fsolveComparison}

Example 1 in Section \ref{sec:Examples1d} is considered to compare the computational time taken of the fixed point algorithm and the inbuilt Matlab function \texttt{fsolve}. Note that the comparison is slightly impacted by the fact that convergence is measured differently in these two numerical methods. However, a general comparison can be made regarding the efficiency of the two approaches.
We choose $n=20$, $N=30$, the ODE solver tolerance is set to be $10^{-8}$ and the optimality tolerance is $10^{-4}$ and $\beta = 10^{-3}$. 
As can be seen in Table \ref{TabA3:Prob1}, the running time of the fixed point algorithm is considerably faster than for \texttt{fsolve}, while the resulting values of the cost functional remain the same. This can be confirmed by comparing the number of function evaluations computed with each method. The differences in $\rho$ and $\adj$ are broadly in line with the optimality tolerance set, however the control differs more because $\vec{w}$ is updated using the optimal values of $\rho$ and $\adj$. (+ Note: fsolve says:'Equations solved, inaccuracies possible' - it never actually reached the optimality tolerance ++)
